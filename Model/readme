Model 23.5 was the model adopted for management advice in 2023. This model primarily follows 21.12 with the following changes:

1. Removed the 1984 and 1987 trawl survey biomass index and length composition data.
2. Incorporated all sources of non-commercial catch in federal waters in the total catch.
3. Revised the stock-recruit bias correction, updated selectivity parameter sharing, and remove unnecessarily estimated fishing mortality parameters.
4. Implemented a standardized CPUE index that combined data from both the hook-and-line and pot gear types (Cheng et al., 2023).

Model 21.12 was the previous model used for management advice since 2021. It uses the nominal CPUE index.

Note very minor updates for 2024 included:

1. Not estimating the sigma_R (stock-recruit variance parameter) per SSC and PT recommendations (following Model 21.12).
2. Turning off the stock-recruit bias correction for MCMC runs (as requested by SSC/PT).
3. Setting Mdev parameter to 0 per Model 21.12 (this was accidentally set to a non-zero value during jitter analysis in 2023).

None of these changes had any noticeable impact on model results.
