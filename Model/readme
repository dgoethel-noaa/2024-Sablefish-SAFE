21.12 is the model used for management advice since 2021. It uses the nominal CPUE index.

A total of five new model runs were developed for the 2023 SAFE, which culminated in the final author recommended model 23.5 that incorporated all individual changes. The models explored 
for 2023 were:
•	Model 21.12: the continuity model matching the 2022 SAFE model but with updated data for 2023.
•	Model 23.1: removed the 1984 and 1987 trawl survey biomass index and length composition data.
•	Model 23.2: incorporated all sources of non-commercial catch in federal waters in the total catch.
•	Model 23.3: revised the stock-recruit bias correction, updated selectivity parameter sharing, and remove unnecessarily estimated fishing mortality parameters.
•	Model 23.4: implemented a standardized CPUE index that combined data from both the hook-and-line and pot gear types (Cheng et al., 2023).
•	Model 23.5: integrated all updates from models 23.1—23.4; this is the final author recommended model for sablefish management advice in 2023.
